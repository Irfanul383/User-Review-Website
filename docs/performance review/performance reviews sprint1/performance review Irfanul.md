For Aron: Aside from the coding part of the project he took the initiative to make notes for each team meeting to keep track of the project and also made the documentation readme files
For Anika: Took responsibility for planning each team meeting schedule and booking the library room.
For Faraz: He played a big part in the restructuring of the project also his code could use more comments and clarity.
For Emmanuel: He is the most experienced coder out of all of us so he helped us with any issues with our codes and took the lead in managing the structure of the project but was once or twice a little late to some meetings.
