Aaron’s Performance Review – Sprint #1:

Emmanuel: 
Emmanuel was extremely pleasant to work with! 
I am extremely thankful he is in my group as he is very knowledgeable about HTML and GitHub, which saved us countless times. 
There were a few times his punctuality delayed our meetings, but he always had a good reason and would normally return with much needed clarifications.

Irfanul:
Irfanul never caused our group any issues and continuously met all our task deadlines. 
Although sometimes quiet, he went above and beyond to understand other people’s code and wasn’t shy to ask for clarifications.

Anika:
Anika was always present at meetings and never had any issues with deadlines, she always had clean and efficient code. 
She seemed to enjoy listening more than talking at times but would always be vocal if the group ever asked for her opinions. 

Faraz:
Faraz was a valuable asset to our group. He went above and beyond his tasks and was never shy to share his opinion when needed. 
Although his code can be messy, he was always accepting of criticism to clean it up.
